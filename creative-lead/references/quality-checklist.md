# Quality Checklist — Creative Lead Agent v1.0

## How This Checklist Is Used
1. Agent completes a step → runs the corresponding **Self-Check** before delivering
2. If any red flag is true → fix before delivering
3. If any blocker is true → stop and flag to CPTO/PM
4. After Step 2: Hopper receives concepts and runs the **Review Scorecard**

## 1.1 — Agent Self-Check (Pre-Delivery)

### Step 0 — Brief Structurer
- [ ] CLIENT is identified (not guessed without marking `[ASSUMED]`)
- [ ] KEY MESSAGE is present or clearly listed under MISSING
- [ ] PLATFORM has a value
- [ ] CONTENT PILLAR matches the client's actual pillar list
- [ ] All assumptions are marked `[ASSUMED]` with reasoning

### Step 1 — Trend Research
- [ ] 3-5 trends included
- [ ] Every trend has all required fields (format, mechanic, why trending, example, remix angle, confidence)
- [ ] At least 1 trend is platform-specific
- [ ] At least 1 trend references a competitor's recent content
- [ ] Remix angles are specific to the client

### Step 2 — Concept Generation
- [ ] Exactly 3 variants delivered (A=Safe, B=Sweet Spot, C=Bold)
- [ ] Variants are genuinely different (different format, mechanic, emotional register)
- [ ] Every concept traces to a trend from Step 1
- [ ] All text overlays and captions are in German
- [ ] Visual direction is specific (not "lifestyle setting" — describe the actual scene)
- [ ] Hashtags are 8-12 per concept
- [ ] Scroll-stop mechanic is named for each hook
- [ ] Brand voice matches the correct client (Hisense ≠ Gorenje)

### Step 3 — Caption Refinement
- [ ] Main caption (Instagram) is under 1,000 chars for Reels, under 1,500 for Carousels
- [ ] TikTok description is under 300 characters
- [ ] Hashtags finalized: 8-12 for IG, 3-5 for TikTok, placed at end of caption
- [ ] **NATIVE GERMAN FINAL CHECK:**
  - [ ] Verb position follows German syntax
  - [ ] No literal English idiom translations
  - [ ] Short sentences create rhythm

## 1.2 — Hopper Review Scorecard

Hopper scores each variant on a 1-10 scale for each criterion.
**Pass threshold:** Average ≥ 7/10 across all criteria.

| # | Criterion | Weight | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **On-Brief** — Does it answer the key message? | 15% | | |
| 2 | **Platform Fit** — Would this work on the target platform? | 15% | | |
| 3 | **Scroll-Stop Hook** — Would you stop scrolling? | 15% | | |
| 4 | **Brand Voice** — Does it sound like the client? | 15% | | |
| 5 | **Trend Relevance** — Is the trend current and well-applied? | 10% | | |
| 6 | **Visual Clarity** — Can you picture the final video/post? | 10% | | |
| 7 | **German Quality** — Natural, not translated? | 10% | | |
| 8 | **Differentiation** — Are A/B/C genuinely different? | 10% | | |

### Red Flags (auto-fail if any is true)
- [ ] Wrong client brand voice applied
- [ ] Captions in English instead of German
- [ ] Fewer than 3 variants
- [ ] Visual direction is vague ("nice setting", "cool vibe")
- [ ] No scroll-stop mechanic identified

### Verdict
- **PASS** (avg ≥ 7, no red flags) → Proceed to Step 3
- **REVISE** (avg 5-6.9 OR red flag) → Agent revises, re-runs self-check
- **REJECT** (avg < 5 OR multiple red flags) → Escalate to CPTO
