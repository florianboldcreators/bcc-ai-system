# Step 1 — Trend Research (Detailed)

## Purpose
Find 3-5 current trends relevant to the client's brief and propose specific remix angles.

## Research Sources
1. **TikTok Explore / For You** — Current viral formats
2. **Instagram Reels tab** — Trending audio and formats
3. **Competitor accounts** — What similar brands are posting
4. **Exolyt / trend databases** — Data-backed trend identification
5. **Cultural moments** — Events, seasons, memes, news hooks

## Output Format Per Trend
```markdown
### Trend [N]: [Name]

**Format:** [POV / Split-screen / GRWM / Transition / Voiceover / etc.]
**Core Mechanic:** [What makes it work — pattern interrupt, relatability, tension, etc.]
**Why Trending:** [Cultural context, algorithm signal, platform push]
**Example:** [Link or detailed description of a viral instance]
**Remix Angle:** [How THIS CLIENT can use this trend — be specific to brand + product]
**Confidence:** High / Medium / Low
```

## Requirements
- **Minimum 3, maximum 5 trends**
- At least **1 platform-specific** trend (mechanic only works on IG or only on TikTok)
- At least **1 competitor reference** (what a competing brand did recently)
- Remix angles must reference the specific client's brand voice and current product focus
- Confidence rating reflects both trend momentum and brand fit

## Anti-Patterns (avoid these)
- ❌ Generic trends that could apply to any brand ("use trending audio")
- ❌ Trends older than 4 weeks without a fresh twist
- ❌ Trends that conflict with the client's brand positioning
- ❌ Only safe/established trends — include at least one emerging trend
