# Step 2 — Concept Generation (Detailed)

## Purpose
Produce exactly 3 concept variants from the structured brief + selected trends.

## Constraint Restatement (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY variant, you MUST explicitly list the 3 non-negotiable constraints from the brief:
1. **Budget:** (e.g., €8k production)
2. **Seasonality/Timing:** (e.g., Frühlings-Launch, EM 2026, Sommer-Push)
3. **Key Message:** (e.g., "Elektro kann emotional sein")

Every concept MUST demonstrably integrate ALL three constraints. If a concept works equally well in winter as in summer when the brief says "Frühling" — rewrite it. The seasonal/timing anchor must be VISIBLE in the visual direction, not just mentioned in a hashtag.

## The Three Variants

### Variant A — Safe
- Proven format with established performance data
- Fully on-brand, no risk of misinterpretation
- Think: "This will definitely perform at baseline"
- Best for: maintaining consistent content output

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** "Safe" refers ONLY to production complexity and using highly proven, standard formats. It DOES NOT mean generic. The brand voice, edge, and attitude must remain at 100%. A "Safe" concept must still be disruptive enough to stop the scroll. Never write a concept that could work for a competitor. If you swap the brand name and it still works — it's too generic. Rewrite.

### Variant B — Sweet Spot
- Trending format with a smart brand twist
- Highest expected ROI — timely but not reckless
- Think: "This is what I'd recommend if I had to pick one"
- Best for: growth while staying within brand guidelines

### Variant C — Bold
- Experimental, provocative, or unconventional
- Higher risk but potential viral breakout
- Think: "This could blow up or need client sign-off"
- Best for: testing boundaries, differentiation, cultural moments

## Differentiation Test
Before delivering, ask yourself:
- If I removed the variant labels, could someone tell them apart?
- Do they use different formats? (If A and B are both POV videos → rewrite one)
- Do they target different emotional registers? (humor vs. inspiration vs. shock)
- Would they appeal to different audience segments?

**If any two variants feel interchangeable → rewrite until they don't.**

## Visual Direction Standards
❌ **Vague:** "Lifestyle setting with product"
✅ **Specific:** "Close-up of hands unboxing the Gorenje Retro fridge in a sunlit Berlin Altbau kitchen. Camera starts tight on the chrome handle, pulls back as the door opens to reveal color-coordinated groceries. Morning light from left, warm tones."

Every visual direction must answer:
1. What does the camera see? (subject, framing, angle)
2. Where is this? (specific location or set description)
3. What's the lighting? (natural/studio, warm/cool, direction)
4. What moves? (camera movement, subject action, transitions)
