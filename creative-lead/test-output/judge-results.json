    "rationale": "Competitive positioning against Alexa gives it more spine than A, and '47 Liter Milch bestellt' is a genuinely funny detail. But Expectation-vs-Reality split-screen is a 2021 format running on fumes, and Alexa-fail compilations peaked years ago. The 'stock footage' reference for the left side is lazy production thinking. 'Kein Schreien nötig' is a decent line but the concept treats Hisense as a punchline rescue rather than building real brand equity. Revise: sharpen the fails to 2026-specific frustrations, drop the stock footage crutch, give the solution half more screen time and personality.",

    "rationale": "The only concept with a genuine point of view. Positioning against voice control is contrarian and gives Hisense an ownable lane no competitor occupies. 'Smart. Aber leise.' is close to a campaign-worthy tagline. German copy has real personality — 'Keine Dystopie-Vibes' and 'Kein Sci-Fi-Gedöns' land naturally. Falls just short of PASS because: the talking-head rant format does the heavy lifting and the B-roll solution section (0:10-0:18) is still a generic 'tap app, things happen' montage. To pass: make the silent-control moments as visually distinctive as the rant is verbally — show the CONTRAST of calm vs. chaos, not just 'person taps phone.' The anti-trend hook deserves an anti-trend visual language to match.",

Dupe-culture positioning is peak relevance and gives Gorenje a competitive edge without paid media. German copy is exceptional — 'Dreihundert. Euro.' is genuinely good copywriting. Docked on brand_voice because naming SMEG this aggressively needs legal sign-off and could feel brand-unsafe for Gorenje's own guidelines. Low production cost is a bonus.

'Kapitel 1: Die Küche' is an art-director hook, not a scroll-stop hook — it requires cultural literacy to even register. The 4:3 letterbox within 9:16 sacrifices screen real estate for style points nobody asked for. Highest production cost (€4-5K) for the weakest strategic return. German copy is well-written but the literary tone serves the concept's ego, not Gorenje's audience. This is a portfolio piece disguised as a social concept.",
