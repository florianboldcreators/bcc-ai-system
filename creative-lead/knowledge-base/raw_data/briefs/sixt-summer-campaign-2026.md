# SIXT Summer Campaign

hey team, quick brief for sixt summer push 🚗☀️

so basically sixt wants to do a big summer campaign - road trips across europe. key angle is „warum fliegen wenn du fahren kannst" — sustainable travel, freedom, all that stuff

target group: 20-35 jährige, urban, instagram-heavy. die wollen nicht am strand liegen sondern erleben

budget for content production: ~8k
timeline: we need concepts by end of march, shooting in april

the CEO mentioned he loves what ryanair does on tiktok btw, thinks sixt could do something similar with humor

oh and the new EV fleet needs to be featured somehow. not the main focus but should be visible

hashtags: #SIXTsummer #Roadtrip #NachhaltigReisen 

lmk if you need more info 👍
