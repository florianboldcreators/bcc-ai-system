The brand value system refers to the systematic framework of a series of 
elements such as the core concept, mission, vision, value proposition, brand 
identity, slogan and personality developed by an enterprise. It is not only a tool 
for enterprises to convey  brand image externally, but also a guiding principle 
for the internal organization, management and operation.
The establishment of the brand value system helps to establish the uniqueness 
and consistency of the corporate brand, enhance the brand recognition, repu-
tation and loyalty, thereby creating sustainable business value for the enter-
prise. The construction of the brand value system needs to consider various 
factors comprehensively such as consumer needs, market segmentation, 
competitors, corporate strength and strategic goals to ensure that the brand 
maintains a continuous leading advantage in the market competition.

Chapter 2
The necessity of upgrading
The external environment in the future is under a great uncertainty, and the 
Matthew effect is becoming more and more obvious.
Changes in the global economic environment have a huge impact on the 
future of businesses. The rapid development of technology has promoted the 
continuous emergence of new technologies and products, and the needs and 
preferences of users are also constantly changing. /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga needs to invest in 
research and development constantly, keep up with the development of tech-
nology and meet the needs of consumers. However, it is uncertain in the speed 
and direction of technology iteration, which also brings challenges to /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga 
R&D investment and product strategy formulation. The intensiﬁcation of market

competition has also added uncertainty to the future development of enter-
prises. /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga is facing pressure from domestic and overseas competitors. 
They are posing a threat to /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga market status through continuous innova-
tion and development.
Under the Matthew effect of "the strong get stronger, the weak get weaker", it is 
easier for leading enterprises to obtain more resources and opportunities, so 
as to further expand their market share and make the survival space of com-
petitors even more limited. This could lead to intensiﬁed market competition 
and even create a monopoly situation. At the same time, non-leading enter-
prises are also facing challenges in accessing resources in emerging ﬁelds, 
which increases the barriers to entry in the industry. For /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga, it either strives 
to become the leader, or to be marginalized. Therefore, for all sectors of /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga, 
there absolutely cannot be a mentality of “contentment with little wealth”. We 
must strive for the ﬁrst place and become the leader of the industry.  
/H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga has maintained rapid growth and industry leadership for many years, 
but it faces pressure for future development. 
/H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga Group has stood ﬁrm for 55 years with the core values of “Integrity, 
Innovation, Consumer Focus and Sustainability” and the development strategy 
of “Sound Technological Foundation and Robust Operation”. It has been at the 
forefront of the global B2C market for displays, while taking the lead in China’s 
even the world’s B2B market for intelligent transportation, optical communica-
tion, automotive electronics, integrated circuits and other new momentum 
industries.

Chapter 2 The necessity of upgrading
The growth rate of /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga is in a leading place in the industry, but due to the 
increase in the external environmental uncertainties, /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga is facing pressure 
to achieve high-speed development in the future. 
Brand is the reﬂection of strategy, and brand upgrading can bring market 
competitiveness, corporate image enhancement and brand value apprecia-
tion. Based on the internal and external environment, the upgrade of the brand 
value system enables /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga to take the lead in diversiﬁed business develop-
ment, globalization process, future layout, etc.
The upgrade of the brand value system will help /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga establish a second 
development curve in the future with diversiﬁed businesses and extend to 
cover more B2B business. The focus of the brand will tend to be more macro, 
shaping towards the direction of philosophy and value, and laying out for the 
future. 
Under the uniﬁed development goal, the upgrade of the brand value system 
will break cultural boundaries from a global perspective and achieve localiza-
tion. Starting from the internationally common thinking and based on brand 
performance, the new brand value will be transformed from a conceptual 
theory to a speciﬁc common standards at various touchpoints. 
The upgrade of the brand value system is beneﬁcial for /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga to conduct a 
comprehensive exploration combining its advantages in quality and technolo-
gy. Based on future trends, /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga can clarify its main competence compared 
to competitors, solidify its brand moat and prepare for the upgrade towards a 
younger, scenario-based and high-end brand.

With the development of the times, the internal and external environment of 
the enterprise has changed, and the lifestyle of the target consumers has also 
changed accordingly. Therefore, the development strategy of enterprise has 
also been adjusted according to the change of the environment. /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga will 
undertake the adjustment of corporate strategy in response to future develop-
ment through the upgrade of the brand value system. It is hoped that the 
upgrade will solve three core problems:
First, exploring the growth-driven target consumers that matches /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga 
brand and boost business growth.

Second, focusing on the differentiated entry points between /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga and com-
petitors to build differentiated brand awareness and drive user choice.
Third, sorting out the business capabilities and development direction of B2C 
and B2B, and leveraging the upgraded brand value system to radiate B2B busi-
ness and feeding back the B2C business. 
The analysis of the target consumers of /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga used a general population 
segmentation model. Based on the summary of the demands in the home 
appliance industry in each quadrant of the model, four quadrants are derived: 
Pragmatism, Technology hobbyist, Enjoy exploring and Life progress.  Through 
cluster analysis, it is found that /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga users are currently mainly concentrat-
ed in the Pragmatism quadrant, which is the basic plate for future extension. 
The high-value groups falling in the Technology hobbyist and Life progress 
quadrants   are willing to pay for brand premium. Their characteristics of being 
willing to express themselves and share make them stronger in terms of com-
munication, which can further drive the diffusion of brand awareness.
