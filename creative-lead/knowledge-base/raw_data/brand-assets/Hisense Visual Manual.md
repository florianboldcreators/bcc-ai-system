everything we do and to symbolize our brand on its own.

Clear space
To ensure the highest possible level of 
clarity and legibility for the brand 
identity, it is crucial to maintain a 
speciﬁed clear space that allows for a 
distinct and complete display of the logo. 
The width and height of "H" in the /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga 
logo is used as the unit of measurement 
for the clear space.
Always follow this spacing requirement 
whenever the logo is utilized (such as 
partnership lockups, logo and a branch 
name in Chinese, etc.)

Social media avatar
The shape of the logo may vary 
depending on the social media 
platform, but it is important to uphold 
its uniform proportion and form. The 
logo features white on /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga Green. A 
clear space around all sides is 
maintained measured by the width of 
letter "e" in the /H_i_s_e_n_s_e.liga logo.

Grayscale logo
To ensure that our logo is clear and 
legible, always strictly control the 
brightness of the background color 
(color images are referred to as 
brightness, while grayscale images are 
referred to as grayscale). This page 
displays how our logo is applied on 
different grayscale backgrounds. Refer 
to the guidelines for proper usage.

contrast in brightness and color 
between the logo and the background 
for best legibility.

displayed clearly and accurately. If the 
background affects its visibility, either 
replace the image or adjust the color 
tone of the logo area.

Examples of improper 
usage

against any background, avoid using 
patterned backgrounds or colors that 
closely resemble the logo's color.

some, but not all, potential misuses of 
our logo. 
Logo's visibility is hindered by the background image
 Background color closely resembles the logo's hue
An alternative logo is used when the green logo is
suitable for the context

The height of the "H" in the logo is used 
as the unit of measurement. The 
minimum height of the partner logo is 
H, and the maximum is 3H. The height 
can be modiﬁed in proportion to the 
width, keeping it horizontally centered.
This principle applies even when there 
are three or more partners involved.
Note: the logo can be adjusted within 
the area marked by the dashed lines.
