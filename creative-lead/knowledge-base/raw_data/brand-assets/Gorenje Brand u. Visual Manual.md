BRAND STORY   
We design for reliability, quality and performance since 
1950. Gorenje has always been committed to innovation 
and delivering user-friendly solutions. Its journey began 
as a small workshop in the village of Gorenje, Slovenia, 
much like today’s ambitious startups. The company 
entered the home appliance market in 1958 with its first 
solid fuel cooker. By 1960, Gorenje had relocated to 
the growing town of Velenje, where it introduced its first 
washing machine in 1964.
From these entrepreneurial beginnings, Gorenje has 
grown into one of Europe’s leading home appliance 
manufacturers, rooted in Slovenian tradition and 
European values. With production based in Slovenia, 
Serbia, and the Czech Republic, Gorenje designs and 
crafts appliances that uphold the highest standards 
of quality, sustainability, and intuitive technology, 
enhancing everyday life for generations.
For decades, it has nurtured strong relationships with 
loyal customers who trust its brand, while continuing 
to appeal to new generations of young families seeking 
advanced technological solutions for simpler and more 
enjoyable living.

LOGO COLOUR EXCLUSION ZONE
The Gorenje brand logo is defined by the typical colour, ratios 
and unique appearance. In order to attain the desired effect, 
clear legibility and consistency with other elements of the 
identity system have to be provided. The gray logo colour 
communicates the ‘soft’ or ‘human’ nature of the brand,  
and departs from the ‘formal’ black-and-white combination.
The untouchable area is the living space of the 
logo that no other visual element or feature may 
interfere with. It spreads around the logo by the 
width and height of the letter “e”. This defined  
area represents the minimum empty area around 
the logo. Leaving an emptier area around the logo 
is, however, recommended.

CLAIM COLOUR
The tagline is one of the key elements of the brand identity system.  
In terms of contents, it communicates the brand proposition; in terms 
of design, it expresses the brand’s personality and values. The informal, 
or handwritten, typeface and the Gorenje Turquoise colour of the tagline 
express openness, relaxedness and practicality, further opening up 
emotively strong interactions. The tagline is ALWAYS written in English, 
communicating the brand’s global character.

2.3.1. Allowed combinations of key brand elements
The characteristic appearance of 
the new visual identity system is 
attained by the use of key elements 
in standardised combinations, 
relations and ratios. In this sense, 
the system is open and flexible, 
while still providing consistency of 
the appearance of messages and 
brand tools.
LOGO WITH TAGLINE
 
 
 
 
 
The combination of logo and tagline is intended
for special (above-standard) cases like business
gifts. The use of fewer elements or features seeks  
to evoke a more prestigious appearance.
LOGO WITH TAGLINE AND  
CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENT 
 
 
 
 
The primary combination includes the use of all three
key elements. It is used whenever the added value
of the Gorenje brand is being communicated using
various verbal and visual messages.
LOGO WITH  
CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENT 
 
 
 
 
Use of the claim has to be avoided in applications
where the brand’s added value is not at the forefront.
Such combination is suitable for direction signs –
e.g. on the facade of a store.

The choice of colours has 
a notable effect on how a 
brand is perceived. Therefore, 
only the allowed colours or 
combinations should be used. 
New colours may not be 
introduced. 
The set of combinations of 
secondary colours allows 
numerous possibilities for 
highlighting while maintaining 
consistency of the brand 
appearance.
In addition to the color 
shown on the right, we use 
white as the base color for 
messages. White may also 
appear as a graphic element, 
such as a white line at the 
bottom of the formats, to unify 
the communication and create 
a cohesive visual identity.

Four highlight colours allow the 
new Gorenje brand identity to be 
expressed of sales promotion. 
These colours may ONLY be 
used as highlighting colours and 
NEVER as background colours. 
Magenta is used to highlight the 
price and other material benefits 
for the user (discount, gifts, cash 
back ...). 
Warm yellow and blue-violet are 
used to highlight the consumer 
benefits and emphasize the 
product’s unique selling points, 
especially when we need to 
showcase them more prominently. 
These colors are primarily used 
on the web and in leaflets.

The key visuals capture authentic 
moments of daily life, presented 
in real and relatable contexts. The 
protagonist at the center represents 
the core target group. The visuals 
are warm, vibrant, and full of life, 
without excessive stylization or a 
focus on technology. People are 
spontaneous, interacting naturally 
with their surroundings and each 
other—never posed or staged.
All directions apply equally to both 
photography and video content.

03  Photo & video approach   3.1.  Style guide for photos & videos
Gorenje users embrace a good life, valuing 
design and appliances as a seamless part  
of their routines, not for show but to enhance 
their experiences. Our brand embodies 
accessibility, authenticity, and empathy.  
It is for people who love life, not chores.  
And when chores are necessary,  
they focus on the results, not the effort.
People want new products that continually justify the purchase, every day. 
Convenience became the third-most important factor in getting value from 
a product. Consumers look for automation and time-saving innovations to 
simplify household tasks. Smart washing machines and dishwashers are 
gaining popularity due to their ease of use and efficiency.

The focus is on the protagonists. The product may 
or may not appear in the background. It remains 
recognizable but is not essential. Authentic emotions 
like surprise or contentment stand out, with natural 
expressions. Subjects never look directly into the 
camera.
The ambience feels warm and natural, with carefully 
chosen props that add style and practicality. Small 
imperfections make the scene feel real and relatable.

The protagonist is the main focus, engaging 
naturally with the appliance or enjoying its results. 
The scene feels authentic and emotionally engaging, 
capturing a spontaneous moment of everyday life.
The appliance stays in the background but 
remains clearly visible and in sharp focus. It blends 
seamlessly into the setting, supporting the story 
without taking center stage. The interaction feels 
effortless, reinforcing how the product enhances 
daily routines.

The product takes center stage in a 
natural, well-integrated setting. It is placed 
organically for practicality and visibility—
ovens at eye level, hobs from above, and 
dishwashers slightly elevated. Authentic 
materials shine, with steel maintaining its 
metallic finish, inox its natural sheen, and 
glass its clear reflection.
Bright natural light creates an airy, fresh 
feel, highlighting the appliance while soft 
shadows add warmth and depth. Light-toned, 
contemporary furniture keeps the space open 
and uncluttered. A minimalist approach 
ensures balance—stylish yet approachable, 
avoiding excess while maintaining authenticity 
and comfort.

The purpose of the appliance is evident.  
It is either in use or visibly demonstrates 
the perfect results of its operation—without

The protagonist embodies a love 
for simplicity, reflected in their 
appearance, expressions, actions, 
and overall mood. They are authentic, 
relatable individuals with a quirky 
charm.
The central figure is a parent who 
enjoys nature, sustainable products, 
and simple solutions for everyday 
life. They are uncomplicated and 
appreciative of small moments. 
They love to surprise and bring joy to 
their children and partner.
Our visuals primarily feature young

The clothing aligns with a homey 
vibe. The style is casual and 
relaxed, yet neat. 
Each piece is carefully selected 
with simplicity in mind, avoiding 
excessive patterns and prioritizing 
high-quality natural fabrics that  
lean toward timelessness rather 
than fleeting trends. It reflects good 
taste without giving  
off the impression of being 
expensive. 
A relaxed style can show creativity

The kitchen is designed to capture the charm of a 
real, lived-in home, avoiding any sense of sterility. 
It’s tidily arranged yet subtly hints at daily life, 
with thoughtful touches like a cookbook,  
a coffee cup on the counter, or a bowl of fresh fruit 
on the table. This is not just a functional space but 
a place where cooking, socializing, and enjoying life 
naturally come together.
The walls, painted in light tones that are not stark 
white, create an open and inviting environment, while 
an accent wall in a chosen color adds warmth 
and character. The impression of natural light 
streaming in from outside further emphasizes the 
airiness and warmth of the space, with soft shadows 
enhancing its dynamic and lively ambiance. The 
furniture is minimalist and contemporary, 
featuring light tones that serve as an ideal backdrop 
for showcasing Gorenje appliances while maintaining 
a sense of functionality and inviting living comfort.

Food always looks fresh, crunchy, 
juicy, and mouth-watering. Pizza 
crusts are crisp, cheese melts and 
stretches, cookies look perfect and 
delicious, and fries are golden and 
crispy. Freshly prepared, whether 
warm and inviting or chilled, the 
food appears natural and realistic, 
with slight imperfections like uneven 
cuts or scattered crumbs. It is 
served on minimalist, pattern-free 
plates, complemented by natural 
materials like wood, ceramics, and 
fabric napkins. Soft, warm lighting 
enhances textures, bringing out the 
crispness of bread, the juiciness of 
meat, and the creaminess of sauces.

BRAND GUIDELINES 2025

04 Communication message
• Concise expr ession
Messages should be clear, 
straightforward, and free of 
unnecessary technical jargon, 
ensuring a human and caring 
tone.
Example: “With the all-new 
G800 oven with full steam, 
you’ll be eager to dive into juicy, 
flavorful results. Just turn the 
button and let it work its magic.”
Why it works: Keeping the 
message simple and result-
oriented makes it more 
engaging and easier for 
users to understand.
•  Connect with  
the users
Our products are designed for 
real human experiences, so 
communication should be warm, 
natural, and relatable, building 
trust by avoiding unrealistic 
portrayals.
Example: “You say you love 
baking. Actually you love a 
crunchy crust. Yum, yum, 
simply irresistible. How? With 
SteamAssist Pro/FullSteam.”
Why it works: Using an honest 
and playful tone helps engage 
users and speak to their real 
needs rather than making 
exaggerated claims.
•  Proactive problem 
solving
Gorenje’s philosophy centers 
on helping users achieve great 
results by proactively addressing 
their needs, desires, and 
challenges in a positive way.
Example: “We bake perfect, 
because you love perfect.”
Why it works: By demonstrating 
how Gorenje anticipates and 
solves real consumer problems, 
communication becomes more 
relevant and impactful.
Gorenje’s communication 
tone is rooted in concise 
expression, a strong focus on 
connecting with the user, and 
proactive problem-solving.

Logo placement
The Gorenje logo with the tagline “Life 
Simplified” must be positioned in the 
top right corner throughout the entire 
advertisement.
Headline placement
If a headline needs to be highlighted, it 
should be presented in the same style as 
in print ads, using large Helvetica Bold 
font. Below the headline, a turquoise box 
of the same width should be added to 
emphasize additional key messages.
Sales telop animation
If a sales telop is included on a recorded 
TVC image, a white banner should 
appear from the bottom to the top at the 
end of the ad. A turquoise rectangle with 
a USP should be attached to this banner. 
The headline should be positioned 
above the USP box, while the product is 
highlighted on the right side of the frame. 
In case we do not have a recorded frame 
or wish to highlight the product even 
more, we can achieve this with a graphic 
presentation, where the product appears 
on a turquoise or white background. This 
presentation allows for a more detailed 
showcase of the product.
Final frame
The closing frame should always feature 
the Gorenje logo with the tagline “Life 
Simplified.” The logo can be placed in 
white directly on the image, provided 
that readability is ensured. If readability 
is compromised, a white background 
should be added behind the centrally 
positioned logo. The logo must remain 
visible long enough for the viewer to 
clearly recognize it.

Instagram offers variety of story add-ons 
such as polls, location tags, animated 
stickers, value sliders. You can use them 
to make Gorenje stories more engaging 
and fun. Native graphics and animated 
stickers should be picked in a way that 
relates general look and feel of Gorenje

Generally you will do good if you take

Target audiences

A dynamic platform with fast-paced content that 
brings appliances to life through short videos, 
product benefits, and creative hacks. Influencer 
collaborations, trending challenges, and interactive 
storytelling make the brand relatable and engaging.
Use one of the two approved logo variations—either with or without the 
tagline Life Simplified. Maintain the safe zone around the profile picture to 
prevent cropping or distortion. Follow the recommended image formats 
for posts, videos, stories, and reels on each platform. Platform requirements 
may change over time, so regularly check official platform guidelines to stay 
informed about format specifications and other updates.
Young adults and students (20-30) looking for inspiration, 
practical solutions, and smart home efficiency, with 
young families also engaged.

The fresh, modern look of the Gorenje POS display was 
driven by the desire to increase brand recognition and 
visibility in the stores, as well as by the need to create 
a fully modular display system that would meet all the 
requirements of the complex retail environment.
A typical display unit is assembled in a modular way  
with 3 basic components:
• a frame with a branding header,
• various product fixture modules,
• accessories.
By combining various fixture modules and accessories within 
the same frame, very different display units can be assembled.
