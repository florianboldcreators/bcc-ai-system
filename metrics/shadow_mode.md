# 🔬 Shadow Mode — Man vs. Machine Tracker

*The Creative Lead AI runs in parallel to the human team. Florian compares both outputs privately.*

## How It Works

1. Real brief lands in Asana (from Account Manager)
2. Human team (Hopper) creates concepts as usual
3. AI Creative Lead silently generates concepts in parallel
4. Florian receives AI concepts on private Telegram
5. Florian compares and logs which one the client actually buys

**Rule:** The human team does NOT know the AI is running in parallel. No pressure, no bias.

## Decision Criteria

**Greenlight Producer Clone when:**
- ≥ 5 rounds completed
- AI wins or ties ≥ 60% of rounds
- Zero client complaints about AI-generated concepts
